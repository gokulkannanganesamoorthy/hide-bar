// BarAdoption.swift
// Pure bar→model reconciliation for a user's native ⌘-drag: menubar-positional

// detection against the last pass, and within-section order fold-in.
// Extracted from AppState so the confidence rules and order reconciliation are
// unit-testable; the app shim replays `log` into PelmetLog and persists `model`.
